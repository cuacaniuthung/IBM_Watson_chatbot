# IBM_Watson_chatbot
like the name of the repo.
This project is a university course assignment where we’re building a website featuring an IBM Watson chatbot. The chatbot provides school counseling, while the project also involves integrating a student database hosted on IBM Cloud. Using Flask, HTML, and CSS, we’ve created functionality to add and remove student data from the database, allowing users to interact with the chatbot and manage student records on the site.
